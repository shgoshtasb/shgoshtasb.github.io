<strong>About</strong>
&nbsp;
Hi, I'm Shirin!
&nbsp;
I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the [Swiss Data Science Center](href="https://datascience.ch/) of ETH Zurich. I am interested in modeling complex stochastic dynamical systems and applying machine learning to tackle real-world challenges. My current research lies in improving the efficiency of Bayesian inference, and creating conditional generative models that can synthesis environmental phenomena.

<strong>Short Bio</strong>
&nbsp;
In the past year, I joined the [SPEED2ZERO initiative](https://speed2zero.ethz.ch/en/), a multidisciplinary project aimed at halving the green gas emissions in Switzerland by 2030. I am working on new generative modelsto synthesize extreme climate conditions (see e.g. [my ICLR talk]() for Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning), to improve our understanding of their formation and impact patterns. Additionally, I collaborate with other projects involving high-dimensional time-series modeling and conditional generation and their application to challenging environmental problems.

<strong>Before that</strong>
&nbsp;
I obtained my PhD in data science from ETH Zurich in 2024 where I was supervised by Fernando Perez-Cruz. My work was funded by an early stage researcher grant from Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie ITN on ML application in communication systems and I had the opportunity to visit and collaborate with researchers in the Machine Learning groups at UC3M and Eurecom, where I worked on Bayesian optimization, sampling and evaluation of generative models. In my thesis, I detailed several approaches to efficient sequential sampling in high-dimensions, drawing connections between annealing and fuctional gradient descent of various divergences (check out [my ICML video](https://icml.cc/virtual/2023/poster/25007)) and exploring application of optimal transport to sampling. 

<!---&nbsp;
Before that I received my B.SC. and M.Sc. degrees in Electronics and Communication Systems at Sharif University of Technology and spent a few years in the Next Generation Wireless Networks Lab, working on development and prototyping 5G Cloud Radio Access Network framework for low-latency remote management and control infrastructures.--->
